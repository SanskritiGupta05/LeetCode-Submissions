## Explanation of the approach:

The query starts by selecting the machine_id from the Activity table.

The ROUND function is used to round the calculated average processing time to 3 decimal places.

In the SUM function, the expression timestamp * (activity_type = 'end') - timestamp * (activity_type = 'start') is used to calculate the difference in timestamps for "end" activities and "start" activities. This effectively calculates the time taken for each process on each machine.

The calculated time differences are summed up for each machine using the SUM function.

The COUNT(DISTINCT process_id) is used to count the number of processes that were run on each machine.

The GROUP BY clause groups the results by machine_id.

The final result displays the machine_id along with the calculated average processing time (processing_time).

This query leverages conditional expressions (activity_type = 'end' and activity_type = 'start') to calculate the time differences for each process. It then uses grouping and aggregation functions to calculate the average processing time for each machine.â€‹
